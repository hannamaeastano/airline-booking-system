## 9. Data Requirements

### 9.1 Data Models
**Airline Booking System â€“ ERD**  
- **Link or screenshot**: [ERD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16CtDjVy6U9NiLjfV0-GbCNmMEO_HEG8k/view?usp=sharing)


- **User:** { user_id, first_name, last_name, email, password, phone_number, date_of_birth, user_type, created_on, updated_on }  
- **Flight:** { flight_id, airline_id, airline_name, aircraft_model, departure_city, arrival_city, departure_date, arrival_date, price, created_on, updated_on }  
- **Booking:** { booking_id, user_id, flight_id, booking_date, flight_type, total_amount, seat_number, payment_status, created_on, updated_on }  
- **Passenger:** { passenger_id, booking_id, user_id, first_name, last_name, email, mobile_number, baggage_details, other_details }  
- **Ticket:** { ticket_id, passenger_id, booking_id, seat_number, payment_method, payment_status, created_on, updated_on }  
- **Payment:** { payment_id, booking_id, amount, payment_date, payment_method, transaction_status, created_on, updated_on }  
- **Airline:** { airline_id, name, logo, email, phone_number, address }  

### 9.2 Database Requirements

#### **Tables and Relationships**  
The database includes the following relationships between tables:

#### Database Choice  
For this project, we are using **MongoDB**, a NoSQL document-based database. The reason for choosing MongoDB is:  
- **Flexibility**: MongoDB allows dynamic schema updates, making it easier to adapt to changes in the airline booking system.  
- **Scalability**: MongoDB handles large amounts of data efficiently, ideal for flight and booking records.  
- **Embedded Documents**: It supports storing related data within a single document, reducing the need for complex joins.  
- **Performance**: Fast query execution for retrieving user bookings, payments, and flights.

#### Adjusted Relationships  
In MongoDB, we use **referencing (ObjectIds)** for relationships between collections. Below are the updated relationships:  

1. **User â†” Booking**  
   - One-to-Many: A user can have multiple bookings.  
   - `user_id` is stored as a reference in the `Booking` collection.  

2. **Flight â†” Booking**  
   - One-to-Many: A flight can have multiple bookings.  
   - `flight_id` is referenced in the `Booking` collection.  

3. **Booking â†” Passenger**  
   - One-to-Many: A booking can have multiple passengers.  
   - `booking_id` is stored as a reference in the `Passenger` collection.  
   - `user_id` is also referenced for passenger identification.  

4. **Booking â†” Ticket**  
   - One-to-One: Each passenger receives a ticket for a booking.  
   - `booking_id` and `passenger_id` are referenced in the `Ticket` collection.  

5. **Booking â†” Payment**  
   - One-to-One: Each booking has a single payment record.  
   - `booking_id` is referenced in the `Payment` collection.  

6. **Airline â†” Flight**  
   - One-to-Many: An airline operates multiple flights.  
   - `airline_id` is referenced in the `Flight` collection.

```json
{
  "user_id": "ObjectId",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "phone_number": "+123456789",
  "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
  "user_type": "customer",
  "created_on": "ISODate",
  "updated_on": "ISODate"
}
 ```

### 9.3 Data Storage and Retrieval

#### **Data Storage**
- The system utilizes a **NoSQL database**, such as **MongoDB**, to ensure flexibility, scalability, and efficient document-based queries.
- **Primary keys (PK)** are used to uniquely identify records, while **foreign keys (FK)** maintain referential integrity between related collections.
- **Indexes** are applied to frequently queried fields (`user_id`, `flight_id`, `booking_id`) to optimize search performance.
- Data is stored in a **normalized structure** to minimize redundancy and enhance scalability.

#### **Data Retrieval**

##### **User Queries**
Users can:
- Search for flights by specifying **departure and arrival cities**, **dates**, and **preferred airlines**.
- View **booking history**, with details on past and upcoming flights.
- Check **booking status** (Confirmed, Pending, or Cancelled).

##### **Admin Queries**
Administrators can:
- **Update flight statuses** (On-time, Delayed, or Cancelled) in real time.
- Manage **payments and refunds**, ensuring successful transactions and handling disputes.

#### **Booking Process**
1. **Flight Selection**: Users browse available flights using search filters.
2. **Seat Selection & Confirmation**: Users select their preferred seat and confirm the booking.
3. **Payment Processing**: The system records payment details and updates booking status.
4. **Final Confirmation**: A successful payment updates the booking to "Confirmed," while a failed transaction keeps it as "Pending."

#### **Optional Enhancements**
- **Caching** could be used to store frequently accessed flight schedules for faster lookups.
- **Stored Procedures** could be implemented for complex queries like flight availability checks to reduce query execution time.
- **Data Archiving** policies can be set up to handle old booking records, ensuring the database remains efficient.

## 11. Glossary

- **API**: Application Programming Interface â€“ a set of protocols for interacting with external services such as payment gateways.
- **ERD**: Entity-Relationship Diagram â€“ a visual representation of the data structure, typically used to model the database for an airline booking system. It shows entities such as Flight, Passenger, Booking, and Payment, and the relationships between them. The ERD helps in understanding how data, like flight details, passenger information, and bookings, are related, and provides a blueprint for designing the system's database.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for backend development to create scalable and efficient web applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of structured tables, allowing scalability and faster queries.
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying a user's identity, typically through login credentials such as a username and password.
- **PK: Primary Key**: A unique identifier assigned to each record in a database table to ensure data integrity.
- **FK: Foreign Key**: A field in a table that establishes a relationship between two database tables by referencing a primary key in another table.
- **JWT: JSON Web Token**: A secure way to transmit data between parties as a compact, digitally signed JSON object, commonly used for authentication.
- **REST API: Representational State Transfer API**: A web service that allows communication between client and server using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **Cloud Storage (AWS)**: A service that enables users to store and manage data remotely on the cloud instead of local servers.

### Code Snippets

- **Flight Search Function**:
  ```javascript
  function searchFlights(departureCity, arrivalCity, date) {
    return Flight.find({
      departureCity: departureCity,
      arrivalCity: arrivalCity,
      date: { $gte: date }
    });
  }

    ```
    This function allows users to search for available flights based on city, arrival, and departure date.

### Testing Plans and Test Cases

- **Test Case 1: User Registration**
  - **Description**: Ensure that a new user can successfully register.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the registration page.
    2. Enter valid user details (name, email, password, phone).
    3. Submit the form.
  - **Expected Result**: The user is created and redirected to the login page.
  - **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Test passes if the user is successfully created and the confirmation message appears.

- **Test Case 2: Payment Processing**
  - **Description**: Test successful payment processing.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Select a flight and proceed to the payment page.
    2. Enter valid payment information.
    3. Submit the payment.
  - **Expected Result**: Payment is processed successfully, and booking status is updated to "Confirmed."
  - **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Test passes if payment is processed, and the confirmation page is displayed.

### Risk Assessment

- **Risk 1: Third-Party API Failures**
  - **Description**: The system relies on third-party APIs for real-time flight schedules and payment processing.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback mechanisms for critical features, such as displaying cached flight data in case of API downtime.

- **Risk 2: Payment Gateway Failures**
